    % README:
    % We will use CVX to solve the convex approximations to the optimal
    % control problem in our SCP implementation.

    % VARIABLE NAMES
    % CVX will only solve problems with 1 decision variable, so to adhere
    % with this, we will form a single, combined variable z = [x,u] by
    % concatenating the state and control variables.

    % INDEXING:
    % Recall that the state at any given time is a 4-dimensional vector.
    % x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, ... x_num_steps) is a concatenation of the state vectors at each time.
    % Therefore, x_1 = z(1:4), z_2 = x(5:8), and in general, x_i = z((i-1)*4 : i*4)
    % For your convenience, we have provided some indexing functions so
    % that x_i = z(x_start(i) : x_end(i)) for each i.
    % similarly, you can access the controls via
    % u_i = z(u_start(i),u_end(i))

    z_old = [x_old;u_old]; % concatenate the nominal state and control to form a nominal z vector.

    %% SET UP INDEXING FUNCTIONS

    n = size(Q,1); % get the state dimension
    m = size(R,1); % get the control dimension
    u_shift = n*num_steps; % what is the last index of z that represents a state? (This is used for indexing purposes). 

    x_start = @(i) (i-1)*n + 1; % get the first entry of x_i in the vector z
    x_end = @(i) i*n; % get the last entry of x_i in the vector z
    u_start = @(i) u_shift + (i-1)*m + 1; % get the first entry of u_i in the vector z
    u_end = @(i) u_shift + i*m; % get the last entry of u_i in the vector z

    %% SET CONSTRAINTS FOR CONTROL EFFORT

    % set the box constraints for x and u
    lb = -1000*ones((n+m)*num_steps,1); % x is the first n*num_steps entries, and u is the remaining m*num_steps entries.
    ub = 1000*ones((n+m)*num_steps,1);
    z0 = zeros((n+m)*num_steps,1);

    lb(u_shift+1:u_shift+m*num_steps) = u_lb*ones(m*num_steps,1); % set lower bound for control
    ub(u_shift+1:u_shift+m*num_steps) = u_ub*ones(m*num_steps,1); % set upper bound for control

    % SET THE TARGET STATE FOR z
    % (the optimization will try to minimize a weighted distance from z to z0 subject to constraints
    for i=1:num_steps
        z0((i-1)*n+1 :i*n) = goal_state;
    end

    %% BUILD THE COST MATRIX
    % so that the cost is (z-z0)'*M*(z-z0)
    M = zeros((n+m)*num_steps);

    for i=1:num_steps
        if (i < num_steps)
            M(x_start(i): x_end(i), x_start(i): x_end(i)) = Q;
        else
            M(x_start(i): x_end(i), x_start(i): x_end(i)) = Qf;
        end
        M(u_start(i): u_end(i), u_start(i): u_end(i)) = R;
    end

    %% Build the linear constraints (which are local approximation to the nonlinear dynamics constraints)
    num_constr = n*num_steps;

    % constraints will have the form C*x == d
    %C = zeros(num_constr, (n+m)*num_steps);
    d = zeros(num_constr,1);
    %A = randn(n,n);
    %B = randn(n,m);
    % Fill C,d with the appropriate dynamics matrices to enforce the
    % constraints.
    % Specifically, for each timestep: x_bar,u_bar is the state and control
    % from the nominal trajectory at this timestep.
    % Using euler integration, we first approximate x_t+1 = x_t + dt*f(x_t,u_t)
    % then, we need to linearize f(x_t,u_t) as f(x_bar,u_bar) + other terms
        % TODO - Please initialize and fill up C,d so that C*x = d
        % represents the linearized equality constraints.
    C = [];
    for i = 1: num_steps - 1
        [A, B, c] = linearize_dynamics(x_old((i-1)*4 + 1 : i*4), u_old(i), dt);
        Q1 = [A B];
        Q2 = [eye(n) zeros(n, m)];
        C = [C; circshift([Q1 Q2 zeros(n, (num_steps-2) * (n+m))], (n+m)*(i-1), 2)];
        %size(A)
        %size(B)
